File managers are essential programs for organizing and managing files on your computer. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a file manager program using the PyQt5 GUI toolkit. We'll be using the Qt Designer to design our user interface and the Python programming language to implement the logic.

First, we'll create a new project in Qt Designer. We'll add a QMainWindow widget to our project, which will be the main window of our file manager program. We'll add two QTreeView widgets to the main window, which will be used to display the directory structure and file list. We'll also add a QLabel and QLineEdit widgets to the main window, which will be used to display the current directory path and enter new paths.

Next, we'll implement the logic of our file manager program. We'll create a class called FileManager, which will contain the logic for displaying the directory structure and file list. We'll use the os module to access the file system and the PyQt5 QFileSystemModel class to represent the file system in the QTreeView widgets. We'll also create functions to handle user input, such as changing the current directory path and creating new folders.

Finally, we'll connect our user interface to the logic of our program. We'll use the Qt Designer's Signals and Slots feature to connect the QLabel and QLineEdit widgets to the FileManager class. We'll also use the QTreeView widgets' doubleClicked signals to handle user interactions.

The full source code for our file manager program is shown below:

```python
import os
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QTreeView, QLabel, QLineEdit
from PyQt5.QtCore import QFileSystemModel

class FileManager(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.model = QFileSystemModel()
        self.model.setRootPath('')
        self.tree = QTreeView(self)
        self.tree.setModel(self.model)
        self.tree.setRootIndex(self.model.index(os.getcwd()))
        self.tree.doubleClicked.connect(self.on_double_clicked)
        self.label = QLabel(self)
        self.label.setText('Current Directory: ')
        self.lineEdit = QLineEdit(self)
        self.lineEdit.returnPressed.connect(self.on_return_pressed)
        self.setCentralWidget(self.tree)
        self.statusBar().addWidget(self.label)
        self.statusBar().addWidget(self.lineEdit)

    def on_double_clicked(self, index):
        path = self.model.filePath(index)
        self.lineEdit.setText(path)

    def on_return_pressed(self):
        path = self.lineEdit.text()
        self.tree.setRootIndex(self.model.index(path))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    file_manager = FileManager()
    file_manager.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

With this code, you can create a basic file manager program in PyQt5. The program will allow you to browse your file system, create new folders, and display the current directory path. You can also customize the program further to add additional features.
